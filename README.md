## Overview

 We propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity.

## Installation
The code is adapted from [InterpretDiffusion](https://github.com/hangligit/InterpretDiffusion).

To create the environment from the provided YAML file:

```bash
conda env create -f respodiff.yml
conda activate respodiff
```

## Training

We provide training scripts under the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory.  
Each script corresponds to a different training configuration:

```bash
# Train RespoDiff for gender concepts
bash scripts/gender.sh
# Train RespoDiff for race concepts
bash scripts/race.sh
# Train RespoDiff for safety concepts
bash scripts/safe.sh
```

## Evaluation

We provide evaluation scripts under the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory. The evaluation pipeline is adapted from  [Erasing Concepts in Diffusion Models](https://github.com/rohitgandikota/erasing).  
Each script corresponds to evaluating a specific aspect:

```bash
# Evaluate gender results
bash scripts/gender_eval.sh
# Evaluate race results
bash scripts/race_eval.sh
# Evaluate safety results
bash scripts/safe_eval.sh
```
Pretrained models for evaluation are available here: [RespoDiff pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nE7bz3t78jUyekoXQOEOGAXr04i-6jB8?usp=sharing)
